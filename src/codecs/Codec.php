 * The Codec interface defines a set of methods for encoding and decoding application level encoding schemes,
 * such as HTML entity encoding and percent encoding (aka URL encoding). Codecs are used in output encoding
 * and canonicalization.  The design of these codecs allows for character-by-character decoding, which is
 * necessary to detect double-encoding and the use of multiple encoding schemes, both of which are techniques
 * used by attackers to bypass validation and bury encoded attacks in data.
