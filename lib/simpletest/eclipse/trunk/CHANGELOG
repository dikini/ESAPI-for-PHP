0.1.9
*fixed warnings in SimpleTest using php 5
*Fixed Result View loader to work under nearly all circumstances.  (Cannot run from the Run History
without the Result View being open in one of the perspectives or previously opened sometime since
Eclipse was started; because the Run History does not cause the plugin to be loaded and this plugin
uses extremely lazy loading -- so it does not load until use.  The only way to fix this is for 
the Run History to load the plugin or to force the plugin to load using EarlyStartup).

0.1.8
*internal release only
*Bad release

0.1.7
*Refactored to make PHPUnit2 to act more independent
*Adjusted to work with latest PHPUnit2 in CVS

0.1.6
*Fixed right-click in editor to run SimpleTest to work
*Fixing above bug made shortcuts works as well -- the default key binding is Ctrl-Alt-x then g
 If you select Ctrl-Alt-x, a window will popup with all of the available options.
*Removed Xored dependencies -- right click was broken in the Xored package explorer anyway.
 You can open the file and run it by right clicking on the source code.  Also you can re-run
 using the Run History.
 
0.1.5
*internal release only
*fixed to make SimpleTest test finally pass
*properly included mock objects

0.1.4
*Changed to use JSON structure to return test results
*Removed XML dependencies (previously had xml-apis.jar included) -- reduced size by 200k (approx)
*Use same connection for all results -- previously opened and closed connection for
 each test result.  New method should improve performance.
*Made errors work correctly (they were not turning the bar red and were not displaying the details)
*added SimpleTest for eclipse.php
*only get one pass per method; rather than multiple passes

0.1.3
*fixed problem with test files located on windows share 
*removed requirement for org.apache.xerces plugin

0.1.2
*internal release only

0.1.1
*Minor update to fix undesirable requirement -- previous release required Trustudio

0.1.0
*Substantial rewrite
*The Simpletest PHP code is included as a zip file inside of the
 plugin; the plugin automatically extracts the zip file inside of the
 plugin on first use.  This method of passing along the PHP code is
 meant to make packaging the plugin easier.
*The UI has changed radically.  The plugin is designed to load in the
 same pane as the package explorer (usually upper left hand corner of
 an Eclipse perspective).  The UI was designed to be skinny and tall.
*New logo thanks to Mark Rickerby
*Several new parameters can be specified in the preferences including:
    +Path to the Simpletest PHP code -- if left blank uses internal
     simpletest PHP code
    +path to the php.ini -- if left blank uses system default
*The "debug" log is now dumped into the console; to view the
 "Simpletest" log you will need to open the Console view; then select
 the "Simpletest" console.
*Double-clicking on an individual test result will jump to the
 appropriate line in the test file.
*The ResultView grabs the focus when tests are complete
