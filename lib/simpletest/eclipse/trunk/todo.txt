debug in simpletest runs? can't be that hard? use xdebug -- all setup in xored
***some code to try this in SimpletestPlugin and TestLaunchConfigurationDelegate
unit test plugin -- requires seperate plugin -- what to test?
code coverage calculation?
create different interpreters to run under then select the current runner and/or specify the runner
display all errors in a test method
fix export.xml to work the first time...it always forgets about use jar
fix the space in php path bug with phpunit2
Figure out how to load the plugin when launching from Run menu -- startup!
*webtestcase functionality
*write tgen4web ant task to create test suitable for use with plugin
*allow per project include file
*if console gives non-empty then make the result view error out
*osstring is failing in OpenEditorAtLineAction 
*if test class has a parse error -- it will bomb -- but returns 255 -- catch the failure and report somehow
*if test class has a runtime error - it will bomb -- but returns 255 -- catch the failure and report somehow
*another way of catching runtime errors is to count the number of tests and verify we get that same number of results back
*FIXED-pending testing-remove jdt dependencies
*FIXED-pending testing-dump output straight to eclipse rather than echo'ing
*switch to LOG_JSON for phpunit3
